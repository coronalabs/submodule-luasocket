	These files are from luasec:

		src/config.h
		src/context.c
		src/context.h
		src/ec.h
		src/ssl.c
		src/ssl.h
		src/x509.c
		src/x509.h


	They SHOULDN'T be built by the luasocket project.

	They SHOULD be built by the OpenSSL plugin project.

	They're in the luasocket "src" directory because they
	were originally written as supplements to luasocket.
	We DON'T want to add them to the luasocket project
	because the luasocket project is a dependency of "main".
	Adding these files to luasocket would have the indirect
	effect of adding OpenSSL as a dependency to "main",
	which we don't want.
